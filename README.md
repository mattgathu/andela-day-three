# Andela Bootcamp Day 3: Simple Interface using HTML and CSS


## Overview

A simple single page built solely with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

### HyperText Markup Language

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for 
creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
images and other objects, such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as `<img />`
and `<input />` introduce content into the page directly. Others such as `<p>...</p>` surround 
and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

### Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language.
Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces 
written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, 
including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, 
or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology 
used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces 
for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications
